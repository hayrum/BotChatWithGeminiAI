NOTE:
Caution: The Google AI client SDK for Android is recommended for 
prototyping only. For non-prototyping use cases, 
we strongly recommend that you use a backend SDK to access the Google AI Gemini API. 
If you embed your API key directly in your Android app or fetch it remotely at runtime,
you risk potentially exposing your API key to malicious actors.
